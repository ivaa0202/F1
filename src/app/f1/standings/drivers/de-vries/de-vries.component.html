        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Nyck de Vries had to wait until he was 27 years old for a shot at racing in F1, but it was an opportunity the
            Dutchman grabbed with both hands to become one of the hottest options on the driver market and ultimately
            land a full-time deal with AlphaTauri.</p>
        <p>Well-versed with F1 machinery thanks to his Mercedes reserve role, which included several FP1 runs for the
            works and supplier teams in 2022-spec cars, De Vries slotted in seamlessly when Williams unexpectedly called
            him up to replace the unwell Alex Albon at the 2022 Italian Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>Embracing the pressure of the moment, De Vries out-qualified and out-raced regular driver Nicholas Latifi to
            take the chequered flag in a highly-impressive ninth place, adding two valuable points to Williams’ tally
            and landing plenty of praise.</p>
        <p>The performance cemented the views of many in the F1 paddock, including Toto Wolff, who saw De Vries lift the
            Formula E title with Mercedes in the 2020-21 season, adding to a trophy cabinet that also includes F2 and
            Formula Renault titles.</p>
        <p>After De Vries’ phone stopped buzzing post-Monza, it was AlphaTauri who won out in the battle to secure his
            services – Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko spending two days chatting and dining with De Vries in Austria on
            the suggestion of fellow countryman Max Verstappen.</p>
        <p>An older F1 rookie than many before him, De Vries will be looking to combine the extra experience he has
            gained over the years with his unquestionable pace and ensure that the sport becomes home for the peak phase
            of his motor racing career.</p>
