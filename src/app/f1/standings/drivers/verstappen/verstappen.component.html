        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>He’s Max by name, and max by nature.</p>
        <p>Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals
            and the sport’s record books to the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro
            Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive racing style.</p>
        <p>F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with
            an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer,
            another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the
            plaudits coming.</p>
        <p>There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established
            number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari’s
            hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero – who then became the first man to
            out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year.
        </p>
        <p>Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his
            peers and paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while
            the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the victories have kept on
            coming.</p>
        <p>They culminated in his first F1 drivers’ crown after that already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis
            Hamilton in 2021. And he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, winning a record 15 races
            across the season.</p>
        <p>The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his
            genes. Despite moving out of Dad’s house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family, and
            though he’s not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.</p>
        <p>Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation’s
            leading light are sky high – but with Verstappen there’s a feeling that the sky’s the limit.</p>
